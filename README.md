# FIFA-Player-Position-Prediction
Prediction of position of a player according to his / her game statistics

Each player has a different preferred position and a differnt position where he/ she plays better. This project simply aims to predict the position of the player into 4 categories -> 'Midfielder' , 'Forward Player' , 'Defense Player' , and 'GoalKeeper'. If a player with no data is queried then 'None' response will be given.
Since, the data is labeled and there, we problem is of classification. There will be a comparision of accuracy and score of classification algorithms -> Support Vector Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
A final function will produce the predicted position of the player.
